    <h3>How did I do it?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Saved money from my sholarships and bought myself a decent PC to start pursuing my "pro" career in gaming.</li>
        <li>How does anyone sleep? You lie down on a bed, close your eyes and try not to think too much. Voila, you're sleeping.</li>
        <li>Studied for school and college because I had to and studied or should I say learned about nutrition and hypertrophy of muscles in my free time.</li>
